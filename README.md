# riffmuse

Riffmuse is a simple CLI tool designed to inspire sweet riffs by algorithmically generating notes within a given scale.

## Usage

Simply pass the scale you'd like your riff in as command-line arguments. Input is not case-sensitive, and can be abbreviated in a variety of ways.

Examples:

    riffmuse a      (A major)
    riffmuse Db     (D-flat major)
    riffmuse Df     (D-flat major -- same as Db)
    riffmuse cs min (C-sharp minor)
    riffmuse o      (octatonic 1)
    riffmuse o2     (octatonic 2)
    riffmuse B pent (B major pentatonic)
    riffmuse em p   (E minor pentatonic)
    riffmuse x      (chromatic)
    riffmuse r      (scale chosen at random)

Or, if you'd prefer, you can type out the full name of the scale, for instance,

    riffmuse Bb minor
    riffmuse bb minor
    riffmuse B-flat minor
    riffmuse octatonic
    riffmuse f sharp blues
    riffmuse A pentatonic minor
    riffmuse g major pentatonic
    riffmuse random
    etc.

Running `riffmuse help` or `riffmuse h` will display these examples.

## Installation

Riffmuse is intended to be installed as an executable file in the user's `$PATH` and run from the command line.

*TODO: release executables, explain how to install on `$PATH`*

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [Boot](http://www.boot-clj.com)

The `build.boot` file in this directory is actually an executable Clojure script, so if you want, you can run it directly, e.g. `./build.boot f sharp blues`.

Or, you can generate an executable and move it to a directory on your `$PATH`:

```
git clone git@github.com:daveyarwood/riffmuse.git
cd riffmuse
boot build
mv bin/riffmuse /usr/local/bin
```

After doing this, you'll be able to run `riffmuse` from the command line, like this:

    > riffmuse e blues

    Riffmuse v1.0.0
    ---------------

    Scale:

        E blues

    Notes:

        1               2               3               4
        | D |   |   | E |   | D | D | E |   |   | G |   | D |   | G | G |

    Guitar:

        1               2               3               4
    A|--5-----------7-------5-------7----------10-------5-------------
    E|-------------------------10-------------------------------3---3-

### Web UI

Running `boot dev` will serve a simple web app exposing Riffmuse as an endpoint -- simply enter a scale (or `help`, `random`, etc. -- any CLI arguments that Riffmuse accepts) and you will see the CLI output.
