# riffmuse

Riffmuse is a simple CLI tool designed to inspire sweet riffs by algorithmically generating notes within a given scale.

## Usage

Simply pass the scale you'd like your riff in as command-line arguments. Input is not case-sensitive, and can be abbreviated in a variety of ways.

Examples:

    riffmuse a      (A major)
    riffmuse Db     (D-flat major)
    riffmuse Df     (D-flat major -- same as Db)
    riffmuse cs min (C-sharp minor)
    riffmuse o      (octatonic 1)
    riffmuse o2     (octatonic 2)
    riffmuse B pent (B major pentatonic)
    riffmuse em p   (E minor pentatonic)
    riffmuse x      (chromatic)
    riffmuse r      (scale chosen at random)

Or, if you'd prefer, you can type out the full name of the scale, for instance,

    riffmuse Bb minor
    riffmuse bb minor
    riffmuse B-flat minor
    riffmuse octatonic
    riffmuse f sharp blues
    riffmuse A pentatonic minor
    riffmuse g major pentatonic
    riffmuse random
    etc.

Running 'riffmuse help' or 'riffmuse h' will display these examples.

## Installation

Riffmuse is intended to be installed as an executable file in the user's `$PATH` and run from the command line.

### Prerequisites

* [Boot](http://www.boot-clj.com)

The `build.boot` file in this directory is actually an executable Clojure script, so if you want, you can run it directly, e.g. `./build.boot f sharp blues`.

You can also run Riffmuse from any directory by copying `build.boot` into your `/usr/local/bin` or any other directory on your `$PATH`, and renaming it `riffmuse`. The script makes use of the source files in this repo, so you'll also need to install the jar file to your local Maven repo. You can do all of that like this:

    git clone git@github.com:daveyarwood/riffmuse.git
    cd riffmuse
    boot build install
    chmod +x build.boot
    cp build.boot /usr/local/bin/riffmuse

You should now be able to run `riffmuse` from the command line.
